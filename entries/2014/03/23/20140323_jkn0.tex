I have now implemented the functionality for adding a tag to the database as described in task \ref{task:20140316_1}. Moreover, I have updated the Python script for adding the new tasks so that the provided tag(s) is/are validated against the diary database. If a provided tag is not in the diary database, the user is offered to add this tag to the database.
