As described in the user guide in task~\ref{task:20140315_jkn0}, it should be possible to compile the diary only for specific tags and dates. The Python script {\tt newBuild.py} should handle this by doing the following.
\begin{enumerate}
    \item The input parameters must be validated and default values for the non-specified parameters must be set.
    \begin{itemize}
        \item If no parameters are given, the default build of all tasks within the last 90 days should be selected.
        \item If only tags are given, tasks labelled with these tags from all time should be selected.
        \item If only dates are selected, all tags and tasks from these dates should be selected.
    \end{itemize}
    \item Scan all files in the entries directory satisfying the selected dates. Create a list of those tasks which are labelled with the selected tags and/or task labels. Moreover, retrieve all other tags as well.
    \item From the list of extracted tags, create the tag dictionary in the {\tt buildFiles} folder.
    \item From the list of selected tasks, create the task list file in the {\tt buildFiles} folder. In addition to including the filenames of the paths, the task list file must also format years, months, and days as parts, chapters, and sections.
\end{enumerate}
