The script {\tt newBuild.py} has now been implemented as described in task~\ref{task:20140324_jkn0}, except for building conditioned on task labels. The list of tag names and tag titles are written to the file {\tt tagDictionary.tex} in the {\tt buildFiles} folder. The list of valid tasks is written to the file {\tt taskList.tex} also in the {\tt buildFiles} folder. Notice that the tags has been defined in a rather strange way to ensure that numbers can be used in the tag names.
