\subsection{Excluding Tags in a Build (Conditional Compilation)}

I have implemented conditional compilation for the excluding tags. An excluding tag is preceded by an exclamation mark such as in this example
\begin{lstlisting}[language=bash]
python newBuild.py "all,!confidential" all
\end{lstlisting}
It can be used to compile the diary for all entries except for one or more tags.
