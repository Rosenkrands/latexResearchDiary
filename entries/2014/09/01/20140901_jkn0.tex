I have updated all the Python scripts so that they now work with Python 2.X and 3.X. I had to change three things to make all the scripts work with Python 3.X.
\begin{itemize}
    \item The print statement has been changed from
\begin{lstlisting}[language=python]
print "Some text to print."
\end{lstlisting}
to
\begin{lstlisting}[language=python]
print("Some text to print.")
\end{lstlisting}
    \item All strings are stored in UTF-8 in Python 3 so the encoding and decoding, which is used in Python 2 to convert between byte strings and unicode strings, is not necessary in Python 3.
    \item The {\tt raw\_input()} function is changed to {\tt input()} in Python 3. 
\end{itemize}
