I have discovered that many of the problems that I observed with cross-platform compatibility were causes by different encoding of files. Therefore, I have decided to store and read all files with the UTF-8 encoding using the {\tt io} module. In addition to updating the Python scripts with this, I have also updated the preamble and the user guide with a warning about changing the encoding.
