I have corrected two errors in the diary.
\begin{enumerate}
    \item Christer pointed out that a {\textbackslash section\{\ldots\}} was missing in the task dictionary when the year was changed, but not the month. I have corrected this now in the current version of the diary.
    \item Jacob pointed out that I had written {\tt addAuthor.py} instead of {\tt newAuthor.py} in the diary user guide. This has also been corrected in the new version of the diary. 
\end{enumerate}
The new version of the diary has been increased to version 1.0.1 and is published on my website.
